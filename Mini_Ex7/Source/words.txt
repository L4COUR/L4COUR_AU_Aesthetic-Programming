Hey! Hey Linda,
come here!
Come outside
I wonder what
Tokyo 東京
looks like,
from up there?
- I don't...
- Why not?
- I'd be scared
- Scared of what?
Dying I guess...
Falling
into the void
They say
you fly
when you die
Its fucking cold
Hey, check out
this book
Alex gave me
Its like
the Tibetan bible
Alex the junkie?
Its all about
what happens
after you die
Look!
So you're going
to become
a Buddhist now?
No
You know
they're all the same
Fucking Catholics, the Jew's ...
Just a bunch
of sucks
out to get
their hands
on your money...
Alex is gonna make
you a junkie...
and then he's going
to make you
a fucking Buddhist
No, he's just a friend
I'm not gonna
become a buddhist...
Alex is a fucking junkie.
He's not your friend
- C'mon
- He's not your friend
I gotta go
Hey, I'll see you later?
See ya.
Lock the door,
just lock the door...
Ok, good
Why does she think
I'm a junkie?
I know I'm not
a junkie.
I know who I am
I know I'm not
a junkie
She's my sister,
sometimes
she doesn't know
anything
There we go
This is
the good stuff
Why else would Bruno
give this to me?
Probably wants
a blowjob.
Thats disgusting!
Who do ya think
I am anyways
I know I'm not
a junkie
There you go...
This stuff doesn't
taste good
These drugs taste
like shit
Wow! Its already
kicking in
This is it...
its started
Oh god,
this is the best
What if you faint?
You're not gonna
faint
I just know I will
You've done this before...
- Hello...
- Oscar... its Victor.
Hey, I'm looking
for you...
Ah, can you bring
my stuff?
Can you come and get it
No... I need you
to bring it to me
Oh... Ok. Where are you?
I'm at the Void...
Y'know I'm really sorry
about yesterday,
I'll wait for you...
Actually...
- Actually I'd rather if you...
- Don't be long...
Hello?
Hello?...
Oh, come on?!
Wake up
Get a hold of yourself
Oh God...
its back
Collect yourself
Balcony
Walk away from that
Keep your eyes open
My head is throbbing now
Its water
Water... Splash water
Splash tap water
Nice clean tap water
Its perfect
Back to normal
Look at your cheeks,
look at your eyes
They look different
Shit
Is that the neighbours?
Did they hear me?
Did I scream? Maybe I did?
Just calm down
Alex. Hold on
Hey Oscar, you alright?
Ah its good man,
how ya doin'
Nothing much...
Been pretty good,
pretty good...
I think I need a shower!
Oh, don't go
to the balcony,
stay away
from the balcony
Hey, have you read
the book?
- The book?
- Yeah
- Oh, The Book of
The Dead
- Yeah
Yeah, haven't finished
reading it yet,
its pretty good.
Its a wild book
I'm glad you like it
Can I keep it,
so I can finish it?
- No problem
- Oh thanks...
thanks
- You okay?
- Ah... well...
- I bumped into
your sister
- Yeah?
Yeah.
Following that cunt,
Mario
I fuckin' hate that guy
I can't believe she's
going out with him.
If she ever gets pregnant,
I'll kill the baby.
I swear to God.
Hey look, anyway...
Do you mind if we go
 and see her tonight?
I'd really like to see her...
Yeah sure
First we have
 to stop at the Void
I have some stuff for Victor
Wanna come?
- The Void?
- Yeah
I don't' like the place,
but I follow you...
...and we go see your sister
- Yeah, lets go
- Great!
- Can I grab some water?
- Yeah sure
Water!
You're not taking it all,
are you?
No, only his share
- Man, thats alot of gear
- Yeah
Shit!? Thats fucking dangerous
You should let him
 pick it up himself
No, he won't come here
anymore,
not after what happened
 with his mother.
- What? He found out
- Yeah...
- How did he find out?
- I don't want to talk about it
Alright,
can I take the water?
- Bring it
- Okay
The streets are really empty.
Is it a holiday today?
- Hey whats wrong with you?
- You tripping man?!
- Yeah. You can tell?
Yeah, you look really fucked up...
I popped some tabs this morning...
and just took a hit
of DMT before you came...
Shit,
looks like a good day!
And the day isn't over either!
Hey, do you think Bruno
has anything stronger than DMT?
C'mon, you'll fry
your brain man!
You should finis
h The Book of The Dead,
that will be a lot better
but wait until you die,
then you get your big trip
The book is
still confusing to me
How would you explain it?
Um,
its really hard to explain...
basically, when you die...
your spirit leaves your body...
...actually
at first you can see
all your life,
like reflected
in a magic mirror.
Then you start
floating like a ghost,
you can see anything
happening around you,
you can hear everything
but you can't communicate.
Then you see lights...
lights of all different colours...
these lights are
the doors that pull you
into other planes
of existence...
but most people...
actually
like this world so much,
that they don't
want to be taken away,
so the whole thing
turns into a bad trip,
and the only way out
is to get reincarnated.
- Is that making sense?
- Yeah, I guess so...
I dunno,
whats the bad trip?
well, you got
all these nightmares...
you know,
you go like,
yo' crazy...
all your fears
become reality
and it scares
the shit out of you...
Its like whats
happening to your mind,
right?
At that point,
you wish you never died...
And, some new
lights appear to you
they represent
all these couples
making love...
and then a light
comes out
from their bellies,
and if you get closer
they give you a vision
of a possible future life
and you choose a life
that suits you the best
you know,
end up in the womb...
and you're reincarnated
end of story
and basically you do this
forever and ever...
until you manage
to break the circle
you follow me?
So you mean,
we're stuck in this world
for all of eternity?
There's nothing better out there?
Hey, y'know what?
I can't wait
to see your sister
She looks real beautiful man
I know
but she's still my sister okay...
I know, I know,
I'm only saying...
I'm not blind,
she's gorgeous.
Fuck off
- Taxi
You should look after her
What are you talking about?
Your turning into a dealer
- I'm not turning into a dealer
- Yes you are,
what we going to do tonight?
You know...
look what your sisters doing,
you know...
she' trying to stop you
from doing that...
Are you schizophrenic?!
- your the one
who introduced me
to your provider
- Ah, c'mon.
Honestly,
you should try to get a job
you know...
I don't know
I mean, your a smart guy,
you know... Good dj
Maybe ask the club
to get you a job
part time, like bartending...
its really fucking easy
I did it
piece of cake...
Especially in Tokyo
You're a foreigner,
you're good looking...
You know,
theres a big difference -
between taking psychedelics
and being a dealer,
you know?
I said I'm not a dealer!
You're a dealer
and you're a
mother fucker, man
I can't believe
you're fucking
that old bitch
You're in Tokyo,
theres a lot
of fucking cute chicks
everywhere,
and you're fucking
some old bitch,
and she's
a foreigner as well...
at least
if you're fucking a Japanese...
- old bitch, you know...
- She fucked me
Anyway...
Oh man...
Police!
Fuck!
Hey um...
I want to dump my bottle...
be back in a sec'
- Have you heard of Datura?
- No
Its crazy shit!
- Whats Datura?
Is it a mushroom?
- Yeah,...
its a plant
that takes you somewhere,
you know
quite freaky...
Whats it...
Whats it like...?
I mean,
Whats the trip like
on Datura?
Ah... like...
you don't even know
you're fucking tripping,
you know...
You'll be on the floor,
talking to
every-fucking-body...
but you realise
two weeks later...
you were not
talking to anybody,
you know what...
I took it, I saw that chick
man she was gorgeous
...hang on a sec, hang on,
she was fucking gorgeous
I really fucking like her,
right...
And I tried to kiss her,
been talking for 30 minutes
tried to kiss her,
she fuckin' disappeared,
she never existed!
THE VOID
I don't want to see you doing
that shit with Victor right, so...
I wait for you at Express on food
and I see you in a minute
- Okay
- Right, I catch you in a minute man.
Yeah, see you later
Linda's right,
Alex is way more
of a junkie than me.
Hope Victor's here already
I don't want to wait for him
I got your stuff.
I'm sorry.
- What?
- I'm sorry

Not a chance, guys' so paranoid
Do you have the money though?
Here you go
The drug guy
hes a dirty bastard you know
Yeah, he likes boys
- Who is this?
- Bruno, the guy that gave me drugs
Don't even take a drink,
you might wake up
two days later
with shit in your mouth...
Or your own shit, you know
I should be able
to get him to see you today
but
I won't come back with you
so you should be careful...
You know what his new trick is?
He can't even
be turned on by fucking now
So what he does is...
Hey, I'm not gonna
jump from here am I?
Hey, once a new guy
gave him a blowjob, yeah...
He sticks his finger
inside his own ass and then
wipes his finger
on the back of their head
So they walk around
with shit on their hair
Thats the guy
I was telling you about
Hey, you look just like me...
- Whats your name
- Oscar
- So what do you want?
- Do you have any LSD?
Lets have a look...
Good, Oscar, check this
What happened to him?
Poor baby,
screaming for his mum all night
Yeah, this is what
I'm looking for...
Cheers, mate
- Nice!
- Good shit!
Hey, do you have any DMT?
DMT?
I might have a little bit left
You ever tried GHB?
Its funny you know
DMT only lasts for six minutes...
But it really seems like eternity
Its the same chemical
that your brain receives when you die
Its a little bit like...
Dying would
be the ultimate trip, you know
Hey, lets try this
Be careful
You see these tunnels,
it leads to huge gutters
you know,
all those bums hiding there...
people go at night
in those gutters...
What do you think?
- Its fuckin' awesome
- Yeah?
Imagine if like
the walls are all clear
and all your friends
are inside, like, fucking
- Oscar!
- Yeah
Come and check it out,
I have something for you
I'll show you that
before you try DM
Tibetan Book of The dead
I'm assuming its about death
Well, it tells you
how your spirit
comes out from your body
after you die
Have you had
a out of body experience?
- Have you?
- Yeah, once
Whats that like?
First - Took me so long to get there
had to practice,
slowing down my breathing
slowing down, slowing down...
Its like my mind is out,
and I can see myself,
just above myself...
I really freaked out because
I would not be able
to get back in my body
Yeah its fuckin' crazy, you know
Yeah its cool, you know
- but...
- Hey its me, again
Check this out, check this out
Hey its me, again
- its me Linda
- Your sister?
Don't forget
I'll be arriving at the airport
Monday evening at six pm...
and you will be there, won't you...
Hey!

When you and grandpa die
what will happen to us?
You'll be taken care of dear
We promise, you'll be taken care of
No! No! No!
Oscar!

You know what?
I dreamt again of the accident
Yeah, well it doesn't matter,

Do you want some more?
Was it good?
Hey, thats for a club
Wanna go?

You gotta take care of her
The men in this club...
Come and dance with me
Hey!, Come on!
She likes me...
Hi heres the deal, you float me the
money for the deal
I take the risk scoring and selling stuff,
we go for a 50/50 split
and we split all the profit
I can't wait! Who's your dealer?
Thats none of your business
because, how much do you need?
Look, where were you?

Say something!

They say
Linda's brother
had a dangerous friend
Who attacked
one of the officers...
And they want us
to let them know
any information
Its in Japanese,
I can't read it
C'mon,

It's positive
isn't it
Yes, it's positive
- You alright?
- Oh, man
You're sweating alot...
So, you mean
I can't
get any coke from you
No.
I got rid
of my entire stash
How do I know Oscar didn't
give my name
to that slime bag Victor
- No it is your fault!
- Who made the call?
I didn't call the police!
You called them!
You called them!
Get the fuck off me!
Hey we're a family here!
Stop it, just stop it!

Don't talk

- You are not the man of this house!
Now get out. Get out!
- What are you doing?
- What do you think you're doing?
- I despise you
- I fucking despise you,

Don't you see she's just using you?
No.
Thats not the point.
It's just that I like Linda
She even want
to have a baby with me...
- Hi

Hey, are you okay?
No man I'm not okay,
I'm in deep shit
Look can you do me
a big favour
Can you go to my place
and
speak to my roommate
Yeah, I need some money
Yeah, he knows where it is
And I need a jacket as well,
I'm freezing
Don't call him,

I'm sure the police
are tapping our phones
Okay, okay I'll call you later
and give you a place for the meeting
Alright, alright cheers.
Ciao.
Mario is just a good fuck
I should have listened to my brother...
I should have been with Alex...
He really likes him
What did he say?
- He's okay
- Thats all we can say...
Why did you bring me here?
The manager isn't happy
with your dance,
we can't keep you any more
but what am I gonna do?
I am not your Daddy,
but I could take care of you
are you asleep?
I would have already
committed suicide
if I didn't have this
sensation...
that Oscar is somewhere
around me...
I wish he could
come back to life...
Stop hurting yourself
I know its hard to lament
But dead...
is dead
Please let us know
if he gets his speech back
That thing
is not my brother...
He's obviously not like how he was...
- That thing is
fucking disgusting...
- Shut up!
Have you two decided
where we going?
Have you two decided,
where the fuck we going?!
Theres...

I could put up with him
Don't fucking touch me!
Lets get the fuck outta here
Hey, wake up!
Hey, hey wake!
They burnt you didn't they?
They burnt you didn't they?
They torched you!
They torched you,
c'mon think about it
Close your eyes
and think about it
If you're lucky
you might find your ashes
Go on you little cunt!
Go on!
Close your eyes think about it!
Go on!
- I ah...
- What?
I had another dream
where my brother
resuscitated from the morgue
Isn't it creepy

in that box
What you gonna do?

Do, what you want
